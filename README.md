The Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) initiative, aimed to provide the branch and division with a comprehensive resource for studying the role of SDoH in cardiovascular disease (CVD) research. This effort compiled over 80 SDoH variables from more than 10 data sources, creating a robust dataset that could be leveraged for various research applications. Given the complexity and volume of data, we needed a systematic approach to make these variables more accessible and interpretable for researchers.

My role was to develop an automated method for generating a 100+ page report summarizing each SDoH variable in relation to CVD. The report included summary statistics, histograms, maps, and correlation coefficient tables, providing a clear overview of each variable's distribution and potential associations with cardiovascular disease outcomes. This process was implemented in R Markdown, ensuring consistency and efficiency in report generation.

The goal of this initiative was to create a resource that could be used internally by our team and across the branch. We wanted to make it easier for researchers to explore SDoH variables and their relationships with CVD, allowing them to quickly assess whether a variable warranted further investigation. By automating the report generation, we not only provided a valuable tool for current research but also established a workflow that could be used for future datasets with minimal adjustments and datasets that would need to be further updated annually. This effort has the potential to enhance data-driven decision-making in cardiovascular disease research and public health interventions.
